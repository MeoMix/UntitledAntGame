summary: I tried hard to be productive yesterday, but got frustrated at myself and spiraled a bit. I cleaned and did secondary chores instead of focusing on my main goals. I ate pretty healthy for the start of the day and incorporated a lot of vegetables, but ate more sweets than I'd have liked as the day wound down.
